REACT.JS - State Managment - Intro

State managmente = state of data in an App

Types of State:
    - UI State (local, e.g. light/dark mode, modal open/closed)
    - Server Cache (API, e.g. list of users)

State can be local or global (If you can keep it local, keep it there)
      Local State example:   You can pass State to children components
      (State) Component A 
                          > Component B 
                          > Component C 

      Global State example:   You create a separate State container 
      and any component of the App (website) can use the State or change it 

What can you use State managment for?
    - UI State (Props, Component Composition, Context API)
    - Server Cache (React Query)

Only use a State Managment Library if you really need to 
      (Redux, Recoil.....)
