Component Composition 

Component Composition is when you want to share props but the components are not direct parent-child 
It requires to wrap child component which will wrap another child component 
Component Composition it is better than prop drilling, but it is bad choice for complex nesting 


the exercise has this structure

App.js

<Input />   --this takes state from direct parent 

<CalculationOverview>                            ---- return <> {children} </>

    <MultipliedByTwo inputValue={inputValue} />  ---- this takes state from parent (children props)
